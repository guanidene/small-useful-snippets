small-useful-snippets
======================

This project contains small python scripts which are useful in day to 
day work. Some are simple cmdline based utilites, while some involve
some sort of GUI.

These python snippets are mostly made by me. I have used, at some 
places, code available on the net for my convenience. I have given 
credits to the person accordingly.


Included snippets (arranged alphabetically) -
----------------------------------------------

* docstring_formatter.py -
	makes nice fixed width formatted strings, useful for making pretty docstrings.

* matplotlib_perfect_plotting_template.py -
	This is a customizable template file for plotting using matplotlib.
	It removes small annoyances of matplotlib and generates perfect images (at 
	specified location).

* notify.py -
	A simple pythonic interface to the commandline utility 'notify-send'.
	
* pasteimg.py -
	Easily save image in clipboard to file.
	
* pdf-to-latex-table-gui -
	Copy paste a table from pdf into the gui and get the corresponding
	code for the table in latex. Note that, this works perfectly only
	when the table being copied is opened using "okular" pdf viewer. 	

* print-A5-on-A4-sequence-generator -
	generates the order in which pages should be printed; so that if 
	you print your A5 sized book on A4 sheets in this order, you can
    "immediately get" a handbook by cutting the stack of A4 sheets from
    middle. After you cut the stack, put the entire RHS stack of now A5
    sheets below the last A5 sized page of the LHS stack of A5 sized
    sheets - and your A5 sized book is ready.

* pyperclip.py - A cross-platform clipboard module for Python. (only handles plain text for now)By Al Sweigart

* simple_dict_grapher.py - makes a graph of a dictionary object using networkx.
