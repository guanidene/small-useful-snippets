=================================

These python snippets are made by me, using little or no external api directly.
This is different from my other project named 'my-first-encounters' as in that
one, I have snippets which demonstrate the use of some api.

Inshort, you won't find snippets in this project with the same utility
somewhere else on the web (atleast in theory), as opposed to those in the 'my-
first-encounters' project.

Included snippets -

docstring_formatter.py
  makes nice fixed width formatted strings, useful for making pretty docstrings.

simple_dict_grapher
  makes a graph of a dictionary object using networkx.
