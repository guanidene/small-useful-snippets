     small-useful-snippets
=================================

This project contains small python scripts which are useful in day to 
day work. Sime are simple cmdline based utilites, which some involve
some sort of GUI.

These python snippets are made by me, using little or no external api directly.
This is different from my other project named 'my-first-encounters' as in that
one, I have snippets which demonstrate the use of some api.

I have used, in some places, code available on the net for my convenience.
I have, however, given credits to the person accordingly.


Included snippets (arranged alphabetically) -

docstring_formatter.py
  makes nice fixed width formatted strings, useful for making pretty docstrings.

matplotlib_perfect_plotting_template.py  
	This is a customizable template file for plotting using matplotlib.
	It removes small annoyances of matplotlib and generates perfect images (at 
	specified location).

	A simple pythonic interface to the commandline utility 'notify-send'.
	
pasteimg.py
	Easily save image in clipboard to file.
	
pyperclip.py
